There are two versions of the tracking hardware which require two branches of the North Star Assembly: one for the released Leap Motion Controller, and one for our next-gen hardware. See the 3D print folder for an organized hierarchy. 

Additionally, we've built out the hardware necessary to mount to two variations of headgear: one from 3M and one from Miller. See the assembly documentation for more details:  https://leapmotion.github.io/ProjectNorthStar/mechanical.html

The Optic Positions file defines the screen locations relative to the reflectors. This file is useful for calibration and building new designs around the same optics.

The Reflector Definition file illustrates the section of ellipsoid that the reflector is defined from. This is very useful for machine shops to create tooling and jigs. Note that the edge of the reflector is all cut from a single cutting plane, specifically designed to make it easier for machinists.
